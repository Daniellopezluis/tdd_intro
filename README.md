# TDD intro katas

Hello there!

In this repo we're going to be working on a set of katas in order to practice TDD. We'll start with simple exercises, such as fizzbuzz, to demonstrate and practice our knowledge on TDD principles.

Hopefully later we can move on to more complex exercises involving the use of test doubles.
